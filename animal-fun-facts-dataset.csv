It is believed that, if a spider could produce threads as thick as a pencil, they would be strong enough to stop a plane in flight. However, farming silk from spiders was largely impossible, both due to the quantity of the silk, and due to the fact that the spiders would attack one another. For this reason, scientists have genetically engineered goats with spider DNA that can produce silk through their milk. They are called spider goats, and they are chimeras—a creature with the genetic information of two animals. In this case, the genetic information comes from two different species.

    Cichlids are an extremely diverse family of fishes, most of which are found in rift lakes in Africa. There are more than 500 species in just three lakes: Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika. Most are specialized feeders, which allows many different types to live together without much competition.",,/wiki/Cichlid
cichlid,https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/bony-fish/cichlids/,"What's for Dinner?
    
    Among the predatory species, tastes differ along with variations in jaw shape. Some mollusc eaters crush the shells of their prey and eat them whole, while others grab the extended foot of the prey and suction them out of the shell. Invertebrate eaters may pick through algae beds or dig through the muddy bottom searching for food. Species that feed on zooplankton usually filter feed in the open water. And although there are many piscivorous species of cichlids, some eat only eggs, larvae, or adults, or certain body parts of other fishes, including scales, fins, and even eyes!",,/wiki/Cichlid
cichlid,https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/bony-fish/cichlids/,"Keeping Count
    
    New species of cichlids are discovered every year. Because scientists don't know how many types there are, creating conservation plans is difficult. As with all animals that are intensely specialized in adaptations or behavior, cichlids are vulnerable to habitat changes, such as pollution and the introduction of exotic species, which can increase predation, competition, and hybridization. Cichlids are also threatened by overfishing and collection for the pet trade.",,/wiki/Cichlid
cichlid,https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/bony-fish/cichlids/,"Many types of cichlids are mouth-brooders. When spawning begins, male blue tilapias dig a pit with their mouths and fins in shallow water. They actively defend their territories from other males while courting females. An interested female lays eggs by the male, which he then fertilizes. The female takes the eggs in her mouth and swims off while the male awaits another female (although in a few tilapia species, males defend the female). The female incubates and hatches her eggs in her mouth. For about a week, the female allows the young to swim back inside her mouth if danger is nearby.",,/wiki/Cichlid

The Caribbean coney (Cephalopholis fulva) demonstrates a more advanced color shift. Normally this fish is chocolate brown with blue-rimmed black spots. If disturbed, the Caribbean coney will try to hide in a coral crevice, which normally has a white, sandy bottom. To blend in with this environment, this fish alters its color so that its lower body fades to white and its spots contract to tiny pinpoints.

snakes,https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/reptiles/snakes/,"Snakes have powerful digestive enzymes that can break down tough materials like feathers, hair, and bone.
